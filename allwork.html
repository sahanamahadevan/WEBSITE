I created this aerial view floorplan of the home of a patient, the orange bubbles signify the barries/problems or even places where a caregiver has to step in to help them. For instance, someone with the disease is always attached to the Oxygen tube and cooking near the gas is dangerous for them. Oxygen is combustible, so this person was resorting to microwaved food until when the caregiver arrives (based on real patient qualitative data, that was studied and mapped).
