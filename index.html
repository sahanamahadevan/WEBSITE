    <p>I exist in the design world to bring joy into people's lives. I do this by harnessing each step of the design process with a child-like wonder. Even in the most critical and challenging moments of a project ,to me, there is always a discovery within the
    ambiguity and the complexity. In a team, I'm a champion for positive attitude and thrive on the energy that brings happiness to others. As an innate reader of people's character and behavior, I'm often the glue that keeps the team together- negotiation
    and co-creation bring me pleasure. Leadership to me, is about bringing out the best in others. I'm always able to motivate myself through the gift of possibility: The possibilities are TRULY endless! </p></div>
