        <p>What does the future of work and freelance look like in a world of democratized tools and resources? Freelancing today is a complicated and confusing web; it is a system of individuals and companies trying to find what they need through disorganized channels. Freelancers are often ill-equipped for negotiation and companies cannot be sure of the individuals they hire. In addition, neither side has a standard set of tools with which to maintain and grow their relationship. This current system is a stop gap it is an evolution of an old and outdated system, it has never been designed of considered from the point of view of either businesses or freelancers.  This is a convoluted web; Employers have to use technology that searches for skills that freelancers have in order to hire them. The connection should be more direct and straightforward. How can it be easier? GILD Fall 2016</p></font></h3>
